## My Motivation

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @charlestsang 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m enthusiastic in Data Science and business analytics. I became a data anlyst in a market research company since 2013. From then on, I have been working on various positions and in different stream fields of data, wich give me many different project experiences within data science. The more I work with data, the more I can recognize the scope of data keep enlarging. 

- Since the data science area has been evolving over time, it is hard to use a solid definition to define what's data scientist. However, as more and more people(expecially more with a phd degree from various fields) enter this indutry, the bar has been raised higher. Though with a working title as "data scientist", I still feel less comfortable as being named a real "scientist". Therefore, I made up my mind to keep learning and iterate my knowledge over data sicence. 

- To fulfill this, I have to catch up with Statistics, Coding, Data engineering, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Visualization techniques, ect. It appears that although I have already obtained a master degree in Information Science (by then it was not yet popular to name a master degree of "Data Science"). I still frequently feel frustrated about complexity of dealing with the data science subject. 

- Besides learnings from subjects from business analytics, economics and statistcs, I found myself a gap in working in more industrial coding techniques. It becomes more challenging when a work requres data streaming, real time machine leanring & deep learning, in-depth data scinece modeling. In fact, I would say it could be more easiler for a computer software engineer to become a data scientist than others from a different background. 

- Personally I enjoyed self-learning. I had joined various online courses and finished several data science program with certificates. I have enrolled on several online platforms such as Coursera, edx, MITxCourses, etc. I don't mind spending time and money on these programs as I belive the outcomes would have been beneficial to the long term development. It does pay back at certain level, which gave me a better understanding and practical experiences in working with data. However, I still feel the gap of lacking systematic knowlegde and confidence in working with fluent codes. There courses talk about many different pieces of the data science, but in fact, there are a lot of fundermental knowlegdes not covered. For example, when it tells how to run machine learning models, immediately it campares various models within scikit-learning packages and got the results which shows a better model. However, a basic understanding of what's naive baye model, SVM, decison tree could easily skip. One key reason is that the university open courses on data science usually expect a student have the fundermental knowledge of statistic, and good computer science skills (such as good coding in C/Python). It appears that such knowlegde is very important for us to go further.

- Inspired by the learning path from https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university I realize it would be a great chance for me to learn in a more systematc way to go deeper and become more confident in data science. I hope I can make this journey and also could share it back to more people who may have been strugling like myself.

## About this project - Hacking data science

- I choose the "Hacking" as I like the book "Hackers and Painters" from Paul Graham. And data is one of key element in business when it talks about growth hacking.
